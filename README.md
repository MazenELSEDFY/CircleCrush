# Circle Crush

Circle Crush is a simple game built using OpenGL (specifically GLUT library) in C++. The goal of the game is to match circles of the same color by swapping their positions either horizontally or vertically. Matching three or more circles of the same color will remove them from the grid, and new circles will fall down to fill the empty spaces. The game continues until the time runs out or a certain score is reached.

## Features
- **Random Circle Generation:** Circles of random colors are generated at the start of the game and whenever circles are removed from the grid.
- **Circle Matching:** Checks for horizontal and vertical matches of three or more circles of the same color and removes them from the grid.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the player's score based on the number of matches made.
- **Timer:** A countdown timer limits the duration of each game session. When the timer reaches zero, the game ends.
- **High Score:** Keeps track of the highest score achieved across multiple game sessions.

## Controls
- **Mouse Click:** Selects circles for swapping. Clicking on the "Play" button starts the game.
- **Arrow Keys:** Move the selection cursor to the desired position for circle swapping.
- **Escape Key:** Exits the game.

## How to Play
1. Click on the "Play" button to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to select the circles you want to swap.
3. Click on two adjacent circles to swap their positions.
4. Match three or more circles of the same color horizontally or vertically to remove them from the grid and earn points.
5. The game ends when the timer runs out or a certain score is reached.
